# firebase-books

learning how to use firebase by creating a simple book logging app with CRUD functionality, authentication and user status.

This is preparation for a larger project that will involve sharing books and assigning trades of books.

There is currently no styling but I will add some to make it visually more appealing.

Tech used:

- Firebase
- JavaScript
- html
- Webpack
- JWT
